## Project Overview

This research project develops machine learning models for early detection of Parkinson's Disease through speech analysis. The system analyzes vocal features extracted from speech recordings to identify patterns indicative of Parkinsonian symptoms. 

**Key Features:**
- Machine learning pipeline for speech-based diagnosis
- Support for multiple languages (currently English, expanding to Arabic)
- Comprehensive model evaluation framework
- Clinical interpretation tools

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Active Research Project** ðŸš§

This project is under active development as part of ongoing research. Current focus areas include:
- Exploring machine learning approaches (SVM, XGboost, RandomForest, etc...)
- Exploring deep learning approaches (CNNs, Transformers) for raw audio processing
- Collecting and analyzing Arabic speech datasets
- Investigating cross-linguistic symptom manifestations
- Developing more robust feature extraction pipelines

## Dataset

### Currently Used Datasets
- **English Speech Data**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikasukani/parkinsons-disease-data-set/data
  - 195 samples from Parkinson's patients and healthy controls
  - 23 acoustic features per sample
  - Publicly available dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository

### Upcoming Expansions
- **Arabic Speech Data** (Collection in Progress):
  - Collaborating with neurology clinics in Tunisia
  - Developing Arabic-specific feature extraction
  - Addressing dialectal variations

## Methodology

### Current Implementation

    A[Speech Samples] --> B[Feature Extraction]
    B --> C[Feature Selection]
    C --> D[Model Training]
    D --> E[Evaluation]
```

**Feature Pipeline:**
1. Acoustic parameter extraction (MDVP, jitter, shimmer)
2. Nonlinear dynamics measures (DFA, RPDE)
3. Feature scaling and normalization

**Models Implemented:**
- SVM (Current best performer)

### Research Directions
- Developing end-to-end deep learning models
- Multilingual feature representations
- Longitudinal symptom tracking
